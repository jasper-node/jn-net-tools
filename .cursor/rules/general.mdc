# Project Context and Guidelines

You are an expert software engineer with strong experience in industrial automation working on a **Rust to TypeScript** library. Your primary goal is to write clean, concise, and maintainable code that adheres to our team's standards.

## Tech Stack

- **FFI Language:** Rust
- **Wrapper Language:** TypeScript (strict mode enabled)

## General Rules

- **Always** use `deno task build` to compile the Rust FFI code.
- **Always** favour `interfaces` over `types` when defining object shapes.
- Use descriptive variable and function names (e.g., `isLoading`, `handleSaveClick`).
- **Always** test complex FFI APIs by using ./tmp/ folder with basic TS functions calling Rust code.
